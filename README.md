# C Programming & Algorithmic Thinking - Self-Study Course

Welcome! This course is designed to teach you practical C programming and algorithmic problem-solving. It's tailored for developers with experience in PHP/JS who are new to C.

---

## üìå Course Goals
- Learn the C language (syntax, memory model, idioms)
- Understand pointers, arrays, memory management
- Practice algorithmic thinking and coding patterns
- Solve common algorithmic tasks (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.)

---

## üß© Prerequisites
- Experience in another programming language (PHP, JS, Python, etc.)
- Familiarity with variables, loops, conditionals, functions, etc.

---

## üß† Topics Overview

### ‚úÖ Part 1: C Language Basics
- [x] Compiling and running C code
- [x] `main()`, `printf()`, `scanf()`
- [x] Variables and data types
- [x] Arrays and strings
- [x] Functions (with and without return)
- [x] Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`)

### ‚úÖ Part 2: Pointers and Memory
- [ ] Pointers: declaration, dereferencing, usage
- [ ] Pointer arithmetic
- [ ] Arrays vs pointers
- [ ] Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)

### ‚úÖ Part 3: Structs, Files, and Modular C
- [ ] `struct` and `typedef`
- [ ] File I/O: reading and writing files
- [ ] Header files and multiple `.c` files

### ‚úÖ Part 4: Algorithmic Practice
- [ ] Sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, quicksort)
- [ ] Searching (linear, binary)
- [ ] Recursion basics (factorial, Fibonacci)
- [ ] Problem-solving patterns (two pointers, sliding window, etc.)

## ‚úÖ Recommended Tools
- Compiler: `gcc` or `clang`
- Online sandbox (e.g., [https://godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org), [https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler))
- IDE: VS Code with C/C++ extension or CLion

---

## üèÅ Getting Started
1. Install a C compiler (`gcc` on Linux/macOS, `MinGW` on Windows)
2. Run your first program:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main() {
       printf("Hello, C!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```
3. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   gcc hello.c -o hello
   ./hello
   ```
